Stupid Simple Email Client For S3 SES Mails And SendInBlue

It's a web interface to retrieve email from an S3 Bucket.  It can send email via SendInBlue.  It's extremely simple, and doesn't offer (nor are there any plans to) any kind of full fledged functionality
(Such as folders, sent items, etc).  It's pretty much just an easy way to read emails that are sent to S3 from SES.
